# COMP6001 17B Swift Report


## Detailed Plan
In this report we will discuss the plan for our Swift Timesheet Application. The Swift Timesheet Application will be a mobile app for the iPhone device specifically. The goal of the application is to produce a detailed timesheet for the scanned or searched object, for example you will have the capability to scan or input a room number or a student identification card and be produced with a timesheet display on the mobile device. The Swift Timesheet Application will utilize some builtin functionality of iOS 11 to scan the barcode for the student identification card and scan the room number, the Application will also utilize network capabilities to talk to an API which will store and maintain student, room and timesheet information. With these tools and technologies combined the application will be able to produce accurate timesheets that can be presented to the user in real time.
